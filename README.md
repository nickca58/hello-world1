# hello-world1
a trial repository

Hello, I am just writing a bit of text about myself in order to merge this back up to the master later...

Ok, so I have learnt a bit of html/css and php used when creating websites using using wordpress. I am currently learning python and more php and want to store some of the code that I have written here as I am sick of losing code on usb drives etc.

Never used this before so interested to see how it goes.

All for now 

Nick
